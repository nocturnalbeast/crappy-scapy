# crappy-scapy

A hacked-together set of scripts that utilizes the [Scapy](https://github.com/secdev/scapy) library to perform some well-known attacks.

This is just a fledgling project, so there isn't much to see here.

Currently, it contains only a semi-working implementation of ARP spoofing attack.

#### Hopefully, there'll be more to come!
